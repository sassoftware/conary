.SH NAME
conary \- repository-based software configuration manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B conary \fIcommand \fR[\fI<args>\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBConary\fR is a software configuration manager that uses distributed,
network-based, versioned repositories rather than disparate package
files as its canonical source of data.  Conary uses the repository
versioning to intelligently merge configuration files, file ownership
and permissions, and so forth.
.SH REFERENCE
Conary has several common command-line arguments, all of which modify 
configuration entries and are documented with other configuration
entries.  The rest of its command-line arguments are specific to
which conary \fBcommand\fP you are running, and are documented with
the commands. The \fIC\fPonary \fIv\fPersion \fIc\fPontrol program,
\fBcvc\fP, handles build and source management, and is documented in
cvc(1).
.SS "System Management"
The following \fBcommands\fP are used to install, update, erase, and
otherwise manage software installed on a local system.
.TP 4
.B changeset <\fItrovename\fP[[=\fIoldver\fP\fI[<flavor>]\fP>]--[\fInewver\fP\fI[<flavor>]]\fP>]+ \fIoutfile\fP
Creates an absolute changeset for \fItrovename newver\fP, or a relative
changeset between \fItrovename oldver\fP and \fItrovename newver\fP, and stores
it in outfile.
.RS 4
.TP
.B \-\-no-recurse
Don't recursively include troves referenced by the groups and packages
listed.  Normally referenced troves which do not match troves in the
\fBexcludeList\fR are included in the changeset.
.RE
.TP
.B commit \fIchangeset\fP [\-\-target-branch \fI<branch>\fP]
Commits a changeset to the repository.  This is not a reversible
operation, so take care.  The \fB\-\-target-branch\fP option
is only appropriate when you commit a \fBlocal changeset\fP
to a repository.
.TP
.B config  
Shows the configuration that conary will use for any 
subsequent commands executed, based on the configuration files it has 
loaded and the configuration-altering command-line options that were 
supplied.  See the \fIFILES\fP section of this manual for more information.
Arguments include
.RS 4
.TP 4
.B \-\-show-passwords
Normally, conary config will mask paswords in repository maps, to avoid their
accidental display.  You can override this masking with --show-passwords.  
.RE
.TP
.B emerge \fI<component>...\fP
Builds the recipe for the given component (which it finds by searching the
\fIinstallLabelPath\fP) onto the \fBlocalhost@local:EMERGE\fP branch
and updates the local system to the new build.
.TP
.B erase [+/-]\fItrovename\fP[=\fRversion][\fI<flavor>\fP]\fP+
Erase all instances of \fItrovename\fP (or only a specified \fIversion\fP)
from the local system. It has the same syntax as \fBupdate\fR, but trove
names which are not preceded by a plus or minus are removed instead of
updated.
.TP
.B localcommit
Applies a local changeset to the local system.  This is exactly
equivalent to making every change represented in the changeset
by hand on the local system, the locally-installed versions still
reference the repository as their source, future updates will still
come from the repository, and the changes represented in the local
changeset will be preserved as if they had been made by hand
locally.
.TP
.B localcs \fItrovename outfile\fP
Creates a local changeset, which represents the changes made on the
local system to \fItrovename\fP, relative to the package as it is
represented in the repository.
.TP
.B query \fItrovename\fP[=\fIversion\fP][\fI<flavor>\fP]*\fP [\fI\-\-path <path>\fP]*
Lists troves installed on the local system. Any number of trove names or
absolute paths may be given. Extra arguments may be given to change what
information is displayed (but they cannot be combined, unfortunately).
.RS 4
.TP 4
.B \-\-deps
Displays full dependency information
.TP
.B \-\-full-versions
Full version strings are displayed instead of abbreviated version numbers
.TP
.B \-\-info
Displays information on the specified troves, including flavors, requirements
and pin status.
.RE
.TP
.B rblist
Lists available rollbacks.
.TP
.B remove \fIpath\fP
Remove the file named \fIpath\fP from the system, and record in the
Conary database that the file has been removed.  After this, doing
\fBconary update\fP will not replace the file.  (If future versions
of the component rename the file, the removal will track the rename;
that is; if you run \fBconary remove /foo/bar\fP and \fI/foo/bar\fP
is later renamed \fI/foo/blah\fP, when you update to a version of
the component that now contains \fI/foo/blah\fP instead of
\fI/foo/bar\fP, \fI/foo/blah\fP will not be created on your system
as a new file.)
.TP
.B rollback \fIrollback\fP [\fIargs\fP] 
Applies rollback \fIrollback\fP.  (Syntax may change in future versions
of Conary.)
Arguments include
.RS 4
.TP 4
.B \-\-replace-files
See \-\-replace-files description from \fBconary update\fP
.RE
.TP
.B update [\fIargs\fP] [+/-]<\fItrovename\fP[=\fIversion\fP][\fI<flavor>\fP][--[\fIversion\fP][\fIflavor\fP]]>* <\fIchangeset-file\fP>*
Updates each \fItrovename\fR from the appropriate repository to 
match the optional \fIversion\fP and \fIflavor\fP given (otherwise the most 
recent version which matches the \fBinstall-label\fP is used).  Also 
applies any given changesets. 
If the \fItrovename\fR is preceded by a minus, the trove is erased as part
of the operation.  If a -- is used in a troveSpec, the version and flavor
before the -- (if any) specify the trove to erase from the local system,
and the version and flavor after the -- (if any) specify the update version.
.RS 4
.TP
.B \-\-exclude-troves \fIregexp-list\fR
Any recursively-included troves whose name matches one or more of the
regular expression in (the space separated) \fIregexp-list\fR will not be
newly installed. If they are already installed, they will be updated
normally.
.TP 4
.B \-\-from-file \fIchangeset-file\fR
Pick troves from \fIchangeset-file\fR, not from a networked repository.
.TP 4
.B \-\-keep-existing
When applying a changeset, do not remove any existing versions of
the troves included in the changeset.
This will work correctly only if the versions have entirely
disjoint file sets.
The \-\-keep-existing option is normally used to add another
branch with the same trove name to the system; after that,
each branch can be updated normally.
If two versions from the same branch are
installed at the same time, this may confuse future update
operations.
.TP
.B \-\-info
Display a summary of what troves will be affected by the update.
.TP
.B \-\-just-db
The update is performed on the database, but the filesystem is not
changed.
.TP
.B \-\-resolve
Attempt to automatically resolve all dependencies.
Can be made the default option by setting the autoResolve flag in conaryrc.
.TP
.B \-\-no-conflict-check
Skip check for troves being installed multiple times from a single branch.
.TP
.B \-\-no-deps
Skip dependency resolution and errors.
.TP
.B \-\-no-recurse
Install only the troves specified, skipping any troves they reference.
.TP
.B \-\-no-resolve
Do not resolve dependencies, only print out any dependency failures.
Unless \-\-resolve has been made the default by setting the
autoResolve flag in conaryrc, \-\-no-resolve
is the default behavior.
.TP
.B \-\-replace-files
When a normal file (not a configuration file or a transient file) has
changed on the system between updates to that file, or if a file
already exists when conary tries to create it, conary normally
aborts the operation with an error message.
If you want conary to update anyway, replacing the contents
of the file with the new version from the changeset, you will need
to provide the \-\-replace-files option.
.TP
.B \-\-sync
Only allow updates to versions that are referenced by other troves on the 
system.  This allows you to easily update a trove to a version specified 
within a group, or ensure you match the :lib component with an out-of-date
version of a trove you have installed.

Perform all actions up to the point of writing to the filesystem.

changeset, only that trove is displayed.  A component specifier, such as 
:runtime, can be given instead of a trove.  In that case, all components 
within all packages in the changeset will be displayed.

option if given) against the trove files as they were  at the time of install,
and displays any differences.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SH JARGON
Conary introduces new concepts and makes new distinctions.
.TP 4
.B Repository
A network-accessible database that contains files for multiple packages,
and multiple versions of these packages, on multiple development branches.
Nothing is ever removed from the repository once it has been added.
.TP
.B Files
Conary tracks files by unique file identifier rather than path name.
(This allows Conary to track changes to file names.)  A reference to
a \(lqfile\(rq is not a reference to a path name, but rather to the
file referenced by the unique file identifier.
.TP
.B Troves
Every collection kept in a repository is generically called a
\fBtrove\fP.  A trove can contain either files or other troves.
.TP
.B Packages and Components
\fBPackages\fP contain logically-connected collections of files.
The files are grouped into \fBcomponents\fP, and the components
are grouped into packages.  Components have a package name, a
\fB:\fP character, and a component suffix; for example:
\fBconary:runtime\fP.
.IP
Not all components are part of a package.  Some components, such
as those with a \fBsource\fP or \fBtest\fP suffix, are independent
components that are related to but not included in a package.
.TP
.B Groups and Filesets
A \fBGroup\fP is an arbitrary collection of other troves, and its
name starts with \fBgroup-\fP.  A \fBFileset\fP is an arbitrary
collection of files, and its name starts with \fBfileset-\fP.
.TP
.B Labels, Versions, and Branchnames
Conary version strings are a \fB/\fP-separated sequence, normally 
\fB/\fP-prefixed, of specifiers of the form
\(lq\fI<label>[\fB/\fI<version>\fB-\fI<release>]\fR\(rq, and
a \fI<label>\fR follows the form
\(lq\fI[<repository>]\fB@\fI[<namespace>\fB:\fI]<tag>\fR\(rq.
A version string is \fBfully-qualified\fP if it is \fB/\fP-prefixed.
The \fI<namespace>\fB:\fI<tag>\fR pair is generally seen together,
and is called a \fBBranchname\fP.
.RS 4
.TP 4
\f(BI<version>\fP
The upstream version of the package
.TP
\f(BI<release>\fP
A \fI<release>\fP is a \fI<sourcecount>\fP-\fI<binarycount>\fP pair
of numbers, where \fI<sourcecount>\fP specifies the source package
the binary came from, and \fI<binarycount>\fP tells which build of the
sources is being installed. Source packages have release numbers which
exclude the -\fI<binarycount>\fP portion. When new versions of a package
are cooked, conary will increment the \fI<binarycount>\fP portion of
the release number.
.TP
\f(BI<tag>\fP and \fBbranch string\fP
\fI<tag>\fP is a simple string that is unique within a namespace.
A \fBbranch string\fP is a fully-qualified version string without a
trailing \fI<version>\fP-\fI<release>\fP pair.
.TP
\f(BI<label>\fP
A \fI<label>\fP does not include any leading \fB/\fP character, and
has the special property of being able to apply to more than one
branch at once.  Therefore, \fBconary.example.com@local:foo\fP might
refer to \fIboth\fP of the following at once:
.br
.B /conary.example.com@local:bar/conary.example.com@local:foo
.br
.B /conary.example.com@local:foo
.br
A label applies to any branch whose name ends with the label.
.RE
.TP
.B Flavors
A single version of a source component can be built many times
with different configurations and for different architectures.
Each of these different builds is called a flavor.  The flavor
is determined by the base instruction set (e.g. \fBx86\fP,
\fBx86_64\fP, \fBppc\fP, \fBppc64\fP, etc.), any extra instruction
set features (e.g. \fBmmx\fP, \fBcmov\fP, \fBsse\fP, \fB3dnow\fP),
and the flags that the recipe was cooked with, both sytem-wide
flags (e.g. \fBnptl\fR, \fBbuilddocs\fP, \fBpam\fP) and package-specific
flags (e.g. \fBkernel.smp\fP, \fBglibc.tls\fP).
.IP
Flavors are
specified within literal \fB[\fP and \fB]\fP characters, first
the flags (if any), optionally prefixed by a literal \fB!\fP character
to invert their sense, then the instruction set specified as a
literal \fBis:\fP followed by the base instruction set, and then
any extra instruction set features within literal \fB(\fP and \fB)\fP
characters.  Examples include
.br
.B [nptl,!builddocs is:x86(sse)]
.br
.B [!kernel.smp]
.br
.B [is: x86_64]
.RE
.TP
.B Changesets
A \fBchangeset\fP is a representation of the changes between two versions
(a \fBrelative changeset\fP) or the change between nil and a version
(an \fBabsolute changeset\fP).  Changesets are used internally as the
main form of communication between the Conary client and the repository,
and can also live independently as files.

The autoResolve option is False by default.
.TP
.B buildLabel

.TP
.B dbPath

.TP
.B flavor
The flavor that Conary will use to find troves to install when the
trove is not yet installed on the system.  It is specified using the
same syntax as flavors are specified on the command line.
.\" FIXME: document how flavors are specified on the command line.
.TP
.B installLabelPath
The ordered path of labels to use when an incomplete version is
specified to install package, query the repository, and abbreviate
versions when displaying them.
Can be overridden by the \fB\-\-install-label \fI<label>\fR command-line option.
.TP
.B lookaside
The transient lookaside cache used only during building, normally
\fI/var/cache/conary\fR
.TP
.B name
The name used in changelog entries when committing changes to source
components.
.TP
.B repositoryMap
Maps a hostname from a label to a full URL for a networked repository.
Multiple maps can be given for a single label. (If no mapping is found,
\fBhttp://\f(BIhostname\fB/conary/\fR is used as the default map.)
.TP
.B root
The path to install files into, normally \fI/\fR.
Can be overridden by the \fB\-\-root \fI<root>\fR command-line option.
.TP
.B signatureKey
Specifies the OpenPGP Key from a local keyring to be used when generating trove
signatures. \fBNOTE:\fR When this option is processed, it clears all entries in
signatureKeyMap. This has to happen for multiple reasons. This is the only way
that specifying \fB\-\-signature\-key\fR on the command line can work correctly.
It's also a convenient workaround for the fact that successive signatureKeyMap
entries are cumulative, which means that if signatureKey didn't clear the
signatureKeyMap, there would be no mechanism to override signatureKeyMap
entries specified in previously processed config files. This also means that if
both signatureKey and signatureKeyMap are used in the same config file
signatureKey should be specified \fBbefore\fR any signatureKeyMap lines. You
can think of signatureKey as a default signatureKeyMap to be used if no
signatureKeyMap regexes match. (see below) This setting defaults to None.
.TP
.B signatureKeyMap
Provides a mechanism to map an OpenPGP Key from a local keyring to a
repository. the arguments that follow are a pair of regex and fingerprint.
Multiple signatureKeyMap lines can be present and will be processed in order.
When a trove signature is to be generated, the signatureKeyMap is checked, the
\fBFIRST\fR regex that matches will determine which OpenPGP Key will be used.
If no regexes match, signatureKey will be used (though it might have it's
default setting of None). It is a GOOD idea to specify a signatureKey line
before specifying any signatureKeyMap lines if you use them--unless you really
meant to NOT override signatureKeyMap lines specified in a previously processed
config file!
.TP
.B updateThreshold
Defines the upper limit on the number of unrelated troves that will be
downloaded at one time from the repository.  Setting updateThreshold to a 
low value tends to result in many small downloads, while setting it to a high 
value tends to result in fewer, larger downloads.  Defaults to 10.
.TP
.BR "Use.<useflag> " or " Arch.<archflag> " or " Flags.<package>.<packageflag>"
Assigns the given boolean value to the flag. 
Can be overridden by the \fB\-\-use-flag \fI"<flag> <bool>"\fR command-line option.
.TP
.B Macros.<macro>
Assigns the given string to <macro>, for use in cooking.  Useful especially for setting march, os, target, and parallelmflags.
Can be overridden by the \fB\-\-use-macro \fI"<macro> <value>"\fR command-line option.  Note that all values are assumed to be strings -- no quotes are necessary around <value> on the command line or in the config file.
